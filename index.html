            <p>This site contains some various web projects which I have worked on over time. The individual projects can be found in each folder. At the moment the site defaults to <a target="_blank" href="https://toalaah.github.io/pTimer/index.html">pTimer</a>, however all other projects should still be availible simply by navigating to their respective directories.</p>
            <h3 id="ptimer-‚è∞">pTimer ‚è∞</h3>
            <p>pTimer is a generic pomodoro timer used primarily for studying more productively. This web-app was made primarily through javascript and is most likely quite sloppy. It still works though so I don't really care.</p>

            <h3 id="enigmagram-üîé">Enigmagram üîé</h3>
            <p>Enigmagram is a tool made for encoding and decyphering simple messages using the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">ROT-N  / Caesar</a> algorithm.</p>
