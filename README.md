## Personal Github-Site

This site contains some various web projects which I have worked on over time. The individual projects can be found in each folder. At the moment the site defaults to [pTimer](https://toalaah.github.io), however all other projects should still be availible simply by navigating to their respective directories.

### pTimer ‚è∞
pTimer is a generic pomodoro timer used primarily for studying more productively. This web-app was made primarily through javascript and is most likely quite sloppy. It still works though so I don't really care.

### Enigmagram üîé
Enigmagram is a tool made for encoding and decyphering simple messages using the [ROT-N  / Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) algorithm.
